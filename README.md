### **TODO Web Service**

This project is a web service for managing TODO lists, built with Actix Web, a fast and reliable web framework for Rust, and powered by PostgreSQL as its database backend. The service offers a set of well-defined endpoints, which are fully documented in the [request.http](https://github.com/ahzamm/todo-service/blob/master/request.http) file.
